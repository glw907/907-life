Device and tool reviews for people pursuing a smartphone-free lifestyle. I evaluate products based on extended real-world use rather than specifications or manufacturer claims — I've been without a smartphone for nearly three years while maintaining active professional and personal commitments.

## Core Philosophy

These reviews center on **intentional friction** — the concept that requiring deliberate steps to access digital services encourages conscious choice over compulsive behavior. Intentional friction reverses smartphone convenience by requiring steps: being somewhere with WiFi, retrieving a device, unlocking it, opening an app.

## Review Categories

Reviews are organized into five categories:

- **Dumbphones** - Calls and texts without browsers or app stores
- **Companion Devices** - Tablets and laptops for necessary digital functions accessed intentionally
- **Auxiliary Devices** - Single-purpose tools like e-readers and GPS units
- **Analog Tools** - Notebooks, pens, and paper-based systems
- **Software & Services** - Applications accessed through non-smartphone devices

## Review Standards

Dumbphones must support group texting and hotspot capability while excluding browsers, app stores, AI assistants, social media, and email. I reject devices that recreate smartphone convenience — every compulsive reach opens the door to algorithmic feeds and the same attention fragmentation you're trying to escape.
