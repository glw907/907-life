This site provides practical guidance for living without a smartphone. I haven't used one in three years, and I address the real challenges of smartphone-free living rather than offering quick fixes.

## Core Message

The solution to your smartphone problems isn't another hack, screen timer, or setting to tweak. I advocate removing the device entirely while maintaining normal social and professional life.

## Who This Is For

This site serves several groups:

- **Working professionals** needing boundaries around constant interruption
- **Parents** modeling healthier technology relationships for their children
- **Teens** facing unique mental health and social pressures from phone dependency
- **People with ADHD** whose focus challenges are amplified by smartphone design
- **Anyone experiencing eroded attention spans**

## What You'll Find

The site includes transition guides, strategies for common obstacles (two-factor authentication, GPS navigation, social expectations), device reviews, and curated research about smartphone impacts on attention and relationships.

## What You Need to Succeed

- Willingness to tolerate initial discomfort
- A planning mindset
- Acceptance of social friction
- A basic dumbphone
- A companion device like an iPad for necessary functions

This requires deliberate preparation before leaving home rather than solving problems on-the-fly â€” a practice normal before smartphones existed.
