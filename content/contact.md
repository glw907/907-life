## About Geoff Wright

I'm a husband and father of three living in Anchorage, Alaska, and the primary author of this site. I love snow, cross country skiing, biking, sailing, trails, books, general nerdery, trees, kindness, and Sunday morning pancakes. I was born in Iowa, and I've also lived in Nebraska, Massachusetts, and Maryland. I graduated from St. Mary's College of Maryland with a BA in Philosophy.

I owned Pango Technology, Inc., a software development firm, until 2023 when I sold my shares to my partners and partially retired. These days I dedicate my time to doing good in my community: working as a small business counselor with the Alaska Small Business Development Center, coaching cross country skiing at Bettye Davis East High School, and volunteering as a sailing instructor at the Alaska Sailing Club.

I haven't used a smartphone in three years.
